# multidb-writing

Make sure to have two databases ready and name them accordingly <br>
The names of my DBs are test_app and test_main <br>
test_app is the first app where registration happens and test_main is in our case "crossplatform" database. <br>
The collection names in my case are: <br>
test_app: users <br>
test_main: testmainusers <br>

Use postman to send post request at this link: http://localhost:3000/api/user/create-user
<br>
Run using the following commands <br>
``
npm install 
``
``
node app.js
``
